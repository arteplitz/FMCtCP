Three Programs Three Paragraphs

I decided to look further into specific “on” commands in makecode. These are specific actions made by the user to affect the CPx. Coming up with some of these “on” commands was a big challenge in our interdisciplinary group the last couple weeks, so I wanted to look deeper into these topics to increase my limited programming knowledge.

Clap Light

The simplest program I could think of for this topic is a clap light. Even though this is a very simple program, the concept of clapping to turn something on has become a popular phenomenon. The Clapper, Clap on! Clap off! is an invention made to turn lamps on and off with the clap of your hands. The block that I used for the clap light was “on loud sound”. I chose to use white as the color for the ligth and set brightness to the max value of 255. This is illustrated in the screenshot below and I will talk about it in my video demonstration as well.

Clap Light that automatically turns off

For my slightly more complex program, I decided to create a clap light that turns off after 2000 ms. However, you can still get the light to come back on if you clap again. To do this, I used a pause loop in makecode inside the original on loud sound event. After the pause loop, I set all pixels to black to turn the lights off. Since there is a forever loop in the program, the clap light will continue to turn on if you clap but will turn off after 2000 ms every time.

Clap On! Clap Off!

For my third program, I tried to see if I could come up with a code to duplicate The Clapper as seen on TV. To do this I had to incorporate a couple more complicated topics on makecode. I used some of my same code from the previous two codes, but used an “if then” statement and an “on start” event block. I also created a variable light to either 0 or 1. Using these blocks as seen below, I was able to successfully turn the lights on and off the CPx!

Lastly, I decided to include my Loom video that I created for all three of my programs. Hope you enjoy watching and learn some about makecode!!

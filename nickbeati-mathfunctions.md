Prototype Two

For my next make code exploration, I decided to dig further into the math functions and using the buttons on the CPx. I have very limited experience with these aspects of the CPx and definitely looking back would have been interesting to incorporate these elements into our group presentations.

Sam, the dancer who used dice in his dance routine, inspired me to look at a program that involved random numbers. For my first program, I used the “on button click A” block to generate random numbers from 1-6, corresponding to the number on a die. This is included inside an “if, then, else” block. For my first program, I used the math inequality less than and said that if the random number generator was less than 3, an arbitrary number, both a sound and light animation would be displayed on the CPx. This is repeated every time you click button A.

My next program is very similar to the code above. In this code, I wanted to use the same random number generator, but have a different sound and animation combination play in either situation. To do this, I chose a sound and animation block which I attached to the else block. This is all included inside the larger “on button A click” block.

For my third program, I used random numbers along with the “on button A click” to come up with a die that radiates a random amount of lights every time button A is clicked. To do this, I used a for loop and used the math block pick random to assign numbers from 0-9. I chose 0-9 because these corresponds to the amount of lights on the CPx (10). I then set pixel color at the given index to a certain color, which displays the number of lights the die generates. To make things more entertaining, I also added a sound to this every time you “roll the die”. Screen Shot 2018-03-19 at 10.18.50 PM.png

Lastly, I decided to include my Loom video that I created for all three of my programs. Hope you enjoy watching and learned something about using buttons, math blocks, and random numbers on make code!!

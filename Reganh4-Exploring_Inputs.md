# Exploring the Inputs Command

As part of our DCS 102 class, individuals explored specific aspects of MakeCode that interested them. We were asked to document our adventures in MakeCode to use as tutorial videos for future users and guides to specific blocks and commands as we explore the capabilities of our CPxs. In this sense, I chose to explore the input command in MakeCode. My first program begins with an “on start” command so it didn’t use the input command.

## The Breakdown 

 1. The video begins with an "onstart" block. When initiated, this string of commands shows the animation of a stop light using the lights of the CPx. Accompanying these lights are a series of sounds I included to mimic the stop light animation in Mario Kart. 
 2. Next, my video discusses my use of the “on button A click” command within the “Input” dashboard. Here, I used light and tones to explore my Cpx. Signaled by the click of button A, my code plays the theme song of Charlie Brown. In an effort to incorporate light into the command, I assigned each tone a specific light color. Continuing this theme, I added an “on button B click” command that, when initiated, continued the Charlie Brown theme song.
 3. Lastly, I briefly explored the “on shake” command in the “Input” dashboard. Here, I associated the chaotic movement of a shake with the loud and chaotic sound of a siren. With this code, my Cpx should begin a loud siren when it is shaken.
